## Project Overview
Welcome to the Side-Scrolling Wizard Game! In this game, you take on the role of a powerful wizard soaring through the sky, but beware! Vicious bugs are swarming towards you, and your only defense is to shoot them down with your magical fireballs. Every successful hit earns you points, but if a bug makes contact, it's game over.

## How to Play
- Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the wizard's movement.
- Press the Spacebar to shoot fireballs at the approaching bugs.
- Dodge the bugs and shoot them down to score points.
- Try to achieve the highest score before a bug makes contact with your wizard.
- The game ends when a bug touches your wizard.
